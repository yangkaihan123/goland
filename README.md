These are my notes from when I taught myself Golang.

It includes the basic syntax of go language, basic operators, function operations, packages, interfaces, coroutines, gin framework, Iris framework and other Web development frameworks.

Incidentally, it is also a way to learn English.

Programming learning is complex, to unremitting efforts, if a book can not understand, see the second time, the third time, one day will understand, at the same time, programming must be manual more code, repeated practice.

I believe in myself, I will learn go language. Come on!!
